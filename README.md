#A simple example for adopting AMap in AngularJS
##Get started
    npm install bower
    bower install
    Open demo.html in browser

##Why you need this?
Some days ago, I wrote a directive to encapsulate the AMap. But there is too many methods exported from AMap, I can hardly make a fine grain. So useing the AMap without directive is also a good solution, which could be more flexible.
